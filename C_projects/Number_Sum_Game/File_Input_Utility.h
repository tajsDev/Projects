Rev 0.0: 30 June 2021, Initial creation of file

UTILITY USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

1) This utility contains functions that may be used for file input operations
   using the C programming language with text files.
   The utility must be linked with the program code with which
   it will be used. 
      
2) Specifications for all the functions 
    are provided in a standardized format below.

3) Use this code at your own risk. There is no guarantee of any performance,
   implied or otherwise, for any part of this code
